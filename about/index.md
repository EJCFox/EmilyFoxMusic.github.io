## Who Am I?

I am a musician. I am a Computer Science graduate. I am a Christian. I will shortly be a full-time software developer. I love Linux. I am on the YouTube. I enjoy pretending to be creative. I write songs. I have an addiction to playing new instruments.

I am embarking on a six month journey of **discovery** and **adventure**. Or, at least playing at being a full-time musician. Same difference, right?

Around the web you might find me doing any of:

* Making videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/FoxxeMusic).
* Blogging about tech, or whatever else is on my mind.
* Releasing [original music](https://emilyfoxmusic.bandcamp.com/).

If you have any ideas for content, or have questions for me, feel free to drop me an email or leave a comment below or elsewhere on my sites.
